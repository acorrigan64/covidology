This goal of this project was to perform the analysis of the geographic sentiment distribution related to the COVID-19 pandemic specifically in the UK. The evaluation of the sentiment analysis, and the model itself, is presented as a Django-based web application which can be viewed at [covidology.uk](covidology.uk).

This work was created as part of a group project for the *Applied Data Science* Unit at the University of Bristol.
